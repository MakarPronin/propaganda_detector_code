,,Yes?
,,"If sewers moving at 90%!• the speed of light, would the air compression deflecting us not cause us do develop into an expanding plasma fireball."
,,"This is a story, Writer."
,,Stories don’t have to ‘work’.
,,I NEED TO STOP!!!
,,I keep writing all this nonsensical blubber and I can’t stop.
,,"Are you, the reader not so confused and uncomprehensive of what I’ve just been typing to the last hour!?!?"
,,"Oh wait, you can’t tell me if you were or not, your walkie-talkie isn’t on the same channel as mine."
,,I just realised something.
,,I work hard to you guys trying to give you quality topics and extra-special rants.
,,And how do people repay me?
,,By writing more than me!!!
,,"I spend all day thinking about things that i want to put into this, and then I type it all up!"
,,"And then I see that people want quantity, not quality!"
,,But no!
,,"You loyal readers will have to deal with me not writing 500 words a day, because I’m thinking of things and stuff."
,,"I was just thinking, I need complain about my life more."
,,That’s what all the people are doing nowadays.
,,"“Oh, my life is so hard, I just broke a fingernail!” BIG DEAL!"
,,"“Oh, my life is hard too, i just broke a finger” BUG REAL!"
,,"” oh my life is mildy uncomfortable and difficult, I broke all of my fingers, toes, limbs, necks, mothers vases, favourite Guinness book of world records records, my most-used language rules, that kinda stuff."
,,"Just in case you didn’t realise, I’m an introvert."
,,So I have lots of problems with… People.
,,And my guess is that you do too!
,,So here are some crucial situations for you to read and laugh at me because you know I can’t hear you!
,,1: You know when your talking to someone and you can’t figure out what part of their face to look at?
,,"Is it their eyes, or their nose, or their mouth?"
,,"So then you kinda unfocus your eyes and stare in the middle of their face, like your looking right through them?"
,,And then they finished talking and you have no idea what they just said?
,,CUZ THAT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME!
,,"2: when your talking to someone and they are saying important stuff, but instead of listening to what they’re saying your just saying yes whenever they stop talking for a little bit?"
,,"3: when you are going into a building and there are people behind you, and you can’t figure out if you should hold the door open for them or not?"
,,"If you don’t and they’re too close, It will probably hit him/her in the face but if you do and they’re to far, its really awkward because you are just standing there for a really long time."
,,Have any of these things happened to you?
,,Leave your answer in the comment section below!
,,"(There actually isn’t one, I can’t figure that much out)."
,,Hedgehogs must find it really hard to have birthdays!
,,"If they have lots of balloons everywhere, they probably pop them; the police come because they think that its gunshots, and there goes all the hedgehogs friends."
,,I’m sure glad I’m now a hedgehog!
,,In section 333 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook it says that free pop-proof balloons will be sent to any hedgehogs in need.
,,"Well goodbye, I’m off to slay a fantastic fedora fanatic!"
,,"But before I go, I have to ask one thing."
,,Did you really make it this far?
,,"Because if you have, the you have been promoted from herder of the rainbow fluffysheep to shearer of the rainbow fluffysheep."
,,It’s a title only few in the world have.
,,Did you know I also make comics?
,,"Probably not, because I haven’t posted any yet!"
,,Well stay tuned for them someday.
,,What’s up with everyone wanting to deep fry things?
,,"Deep fried mars bars, deep fries cool aid!"
,,Well I’ve come up with a new food type!
,,‘Shallow fried’ available at all good pharmancy checkout lines beside the mayacamole and the taco sauce.
,,"(That sounds really good!(jut i case you didn’t know, mayacamole is mayo and guacamole combined."
,,"Doesn’t that sound MAGICALLY DELICIOUS!!!( I think it does))) shallow fried stuff has half the fat, uses half the ‘deep fry juice’ (whatever they put in there) and has have the flavour!"
,,For twice the price!
,,Even though we never had an original price.
,,Whatever.
,,Do you know what’s the worst?
,,Trying to buy computer – related things in charity shops.
,,"I was at value village, and I saw a USB."
,,It was 64 gigabytes!
,,That’s pretty good (I bet if your are reading this in the distant future than you think that a 64 gigabyte USB is awful.
,,"Well it isn’t in this day and age) I thought, so I went to buy it."
,,It’s only two bucks!
,,"Wow, what a steal."
,,I looked closer at it and that’s when I realised.
,,It said 64 MEGABYTES!!!
,,DO YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE THAT IS!
,,if you are from the distant future than you are probably thing ‘that’s like nothing’ and you’d be right.
,,It can only store like 60 million letters!
,,That’s only 15 million words!
,,That’s only a million sentences!
,,"That’s only 200,000 paragraphs!"
,,"That’s only 20,000 chapters!"
,,"That’s only 1,000 Books!"
,,That’s only 250 quadrilogies!
,,"Now that I think about it, 250 quadrilogies isn’t that bad."
,,"If you couldn’t tell, I used a method called Fermi Estimation, though a little more precise."
,,"In Fermi Estimation, you can be off by 100x in either direction and it doesn’t really matter."
,,"According to Fermi Estimation, this is me."
,,Age: 10 Number of eyes: 1 Social Security Number: 1000000 PIN code: 1000 number of limbs: 1 people in my family: 1 (forever alone).
,,That’s why I like Fermi Estimation.
,,I actually didn’t tell you why I like it.
,,Oh well.
,,"Where I live, they use blackcurrant in everything."
,,It’s pretty much a replacement for grape.
,,But am I the only one who thinks that grape flavoured things taste way better?
,,"Whenever I get something blackcurrant flavoured I offer it someone, because they usually like it (and I hate it)."
,,Works well for me!!
,,I was just thinking about tides.
,,"Way back in the day, wouldn’t tides make no sense?"
,,The sea would just get higher and lower and there was no reasoning behind it.
,,Maybe that’s why they thought sea monsters existed.
,,"No what I think about it though, the moon pulling on the water is kinda even crazier than that."
,,And now for a commercial break.
,,Kshhhhhh – Tacos…… I LOVE EM!
,,And you can to for only ten easy payments of ten bucks!
,,(That’s deer by the way) tacos can make you feel fuzzy in the inside.
,,That’s because of the mould that comes FREE with every purchase!
,,And there’s no artificial additives either!
,,"(We did that by adding so many additives that instead of adding it to the taco, we were technically adding the taco to the additives)."
,,What are you waiting for!
,,I’m waiting for this commercial to end so I can get paid!
,,Call now at 1800-GOT-PUNK to order a taco from Teddys Tacos (or would it be Teddies) and you will get a free rent-a-friend with your purchase!
,,But there’s more!
,,Order now and get a free Ferrari too!
,,Oh it seems our lines are down its too late.
,,They’re back up again!
,,But it’s too late!
,,I use too many exclamation marks!
,,But there’s more!
,,Be the 7.8×10^9 customer to order to get a free home with your choice of a happy meal toy!
,,KSHHHHHH .
,,I think that people complain about preservatives way to much.
,,"They all say “oh, it’s SOOOO unhealthy” but I think that month-past-the-expiration-date-food is way more unhealthy."
,,The end of that.
,,Goodbye.Do you do two extra languages in school?
,,If so you will know what I mean.
,,"Every time I have to study for one language, I ALWAYS remember the word from the other language!"
,,Like when I’m learning Japanese I’ll think what was ‘how are you’ again?
,,"Oh yea, it’s frickin ÇA VA!!!"
,,(Sorry if I’m being too edgy) in section 250q4 of the Rainbow Fluffysheep handbook it states that English is the best language and no one should be forced to learn any other.
,,"If they are, they must fill up a bath tub with alpabits which spell out the word that they uttered and eat all of it without any sugar sprinkled on top (NOOOOO)."
,,That sounded a little bit cliché.
,,GO TO THE TUB YOUNG MAN!
,,ok.
,,"Well, that’s all I got for today."
,,See ya!
,,I’m back here again!
,,Another hour of my life will be wasted in the next few… Minutes?
,,That previous (the auto correct is so bad on this phone it corrected previous to peeler oohs) sentence made no sense whatsoever.
,,I have a conspiracy for you guys today!
,,(Or 4 U Guys 2Day if I want to sound ‘Hip’).
,,"Don’t worry, it’s not as long as that Illuminati one (although I was thinking about doing another one of those soon."
,,So stay tuned!).
,,I think school is a scam!
,,Have you ever noticed that everyone says that the government is trying to brainwash people?
,,Well the LAST place you would think to look for that kind of activity is a government-funded learning program!
,,The government is trying to teach people nonsense to make the population stupid.
,,Like when will I ever need to know about the themes and plot devices in To Kill A Mockingbird?
,,Or how to calculate the area under a curve?
,,Or even that in 1812 a war happened that doesn’t affect me today!
,,"They could be teaching us important things, like how to pay bills, how to get a job, how to overthrow the government and all political world leaders for entire globe domination, how to use bendy straws, you know, the IMPORTANT STUFF!"
,,"(By the way, one of those things was not like the others)."
,,That was my conspiracy.
,,I don’t think that anyone has actually read to this far.
,,I don’t actually have any proof that anyone has.
,,"But if you have, here is proof."
,,A tiny quiz to test how well you really know this LoTeEv.
,,"Email all the answers to me atrainbowflufysheep123@gmail.com, for a chance to win a response from me and a chance to tell me what you think of this site!"

,,"(I mean, if you want)."
,,"If your like me and have a lonely YouTube channel with five views because you watched it five times, the his is the prize for you!"
,,"Anyway, enough with that."
,,An i the only person that thinks buying name brand stuff is dumb?
,,People are pretty much PAYING to advertise a company.
,,People want the logo for the company because it looks ‘cool’.
,,What if you bought a shirt from The Dump?
,,Would you want it to have a ‘The Dump’ logo on it?
,,"(Actually, I have no idea what point I was trying to make)."
,,"I once heard a saying: you aren’t popular if you spend a thousand dollars on a jacket, but you at if the company that makes it spend a thousand dollars for you to wear it."
,,(Now that I think about it i feel like I may have possibly made that up).
,,You get what I’m saying though?
,,I hope you do.
,,"Well, that’s my stuff for today."
,,See ya!
,,I’m back!
,,And do I got stuffs to say!
,,Do you personally know ANYONE who uses exercise balls for their intended purpose?
,,"Either we play soccer with them, or we bowl with them, or we throw them really hard at people."
,,"Now that I think about it for a little bit, what IS an exercise balls intended purpose?"
,,I’ll leave that question for you guys to figure out!
,,Have you heard about that new law that teachers are allow to have guns in schools?
,,"I don’t know what your opinion is on that subject, but I think it’s an awful idea, at least in my school."
,,"For reference, here is a clip of a conversation between my construction and my English teacher."
,,I will name the construction teacher mr.
,,Hardy and the English teacher ms.
,,Poema: “hey ms.
,,"Poema, have you heard about that new ‘teachers are allowed to have guns in school’ law?” “In fact I have mr."
,,Hardy” ” I can’t wait to have mine.
,,"I’m gonna get one of the big ones too, so I can take down the whole class in one go.” “I’m gonna get one of those little ones that you can hide in your sock” “but then you’ll have to take down the students one at a time!” Now I’m no ‘expert’ on education, but is it even LEGAL for teachers to say stuff like that?"
,,"I thought it was funny, but what if there was a new student at school that day, and they thought that the teachers were psychos!?!?"
,,The students already there are used to their teachers being like that though.
,,I have more evidence that the teachers here are crazy!
,,"One day my brother borrowed a camera from the school, and Mr."
,,Hardy (what a coincidence) had to collect it from him when he was done.
,,Mr.
,,"Hardy said that if he didn’t bring back the camera by tomorrow, he would have to emigrate to a Muslim country where he would be covered from head to toe, and Mr."
,,Hardy would personally be sent from the school board to seek him out and assassinate him!
,,"It’s just a camera, calm down Mr."
,,Hardy.
,,"And the NEXT day he went up to him and said he must have brought the camera back, or else he would be hiding in the trenches of Afghanistan!!!"
,,And that’s why I didn’t do construction in school (and because I wasn’t good at it).
,,That’s enough about my CrAzY life.
,,Bye!!!
,,It’s been a REALLY long time (like a week).
,,And I just thought of something great.
,,Isn’t cereal actually a soup?
,,Well now you’re going to be thinking about that for the rest of your life :).
,,I’m going to addition to the RFSRQP (the Rainbow FluffySheep Rhetorical Questions Page).
,,Also to be added: Are there more hard things or soft things in the world?
,,What is the average size of a rock?
,,What is the meaning of life?
,,Does nine plus ten truly equal twenty-one?
,,Why do whales have blowholes?
,,What colour is the dress?
,,How long is a Fortnite?
,,How long is a PUBG?
,,How is plastic made from oil?
,,How is oil made from dead stuff?
,,Why do people eat Cheetos if they get that orange dust everywhere?
,,Why do people celebrate pi day but not tau day?
,,These are all important question you need to ask yourself.
,,I know the answer to one of them.
,,"It’s because it sounds like pie, if half of pi was called Kaek, they would probably celebrate It too."
,,"I’m sorry to say guys, but I have finally and truly decided to stop writing this LoTeEv."
,,"I have to pursue other things, like my life."
,,Goodbye forever….
,,— … APRIL FOOLS!!!
,,HAHAHA!
,,APRIL FOOLS FOOL!
,,Today is April Fools day and I have so many ideas.
,,"So far these are my dubious schemes: I have turned only one corner of my brothers Rubik’s cube to render it unsolvable (the only way is to take it apart), put the movie in the DVD player upside down so it doesn’t play, and I stole my brothers Easter egg (as I say it now that last one doesn’t really seem like a prank)."
,,"But he got me back, because he: put an avocado in the coffee maker, tied a air refreshener to the door so when you open it it sprays everywhere, and threatened me with a knife that turned out to just be a comb."
,,Isn’t it great?
,,I have a weird family.
,,Hey!
,,We were all LIED to in kindergarten!
,,"Remember you teacher always used to say to you “remember children, I before E, except after C!” We’ll you were SCAMMED!"
,,Take the word ‘weird’ as an example.
,,See what wrong here!?!?
,,"It has the I AFTER E, and not after C!"
,,Now if you don’t trust the school system then I don’t know what your doing with your brain.
,,You should go on strike!
,,I just fit in the second ‘piece’ of the puzzle!
,,"When I was little, I use to always say “if it rhymes its true”."
,,That was like my motto!
,,"And secretly, you could manipulate any sentence to succumb to the malevolent power of that prestigious rule."
,,"You could say “broccoli is bad, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!” But then you could ALSO say “ice-cream is good, so they say; and it rhymes so it is true today!”."
,,See what I did there?
,,I thought that it was GENIUS!
,,Until it got used against me.
,,"All I had to do was change the rule to “it’s true if it rhymes, but only sometimes”."
,,And that worked perfectly.
,,Fun Fact Of The Paragraph: Leicester is actually not pronounced lay-ches-ter.
,,It’s les-ter.
,,That makes no sense whatsoever!
,,I still thought you would like to know that.
,,I have a great idea!
,,I should talk about my middle school!
,,"Ah, way back in the day that was."
,,When I was a wee 13 year old lad.
,,There used to be this bench at the school where people would go to make a friend.
,,I think people were supposed to come and invite them to play a game.
,,But what REALLY happened is that people would just walk past and shout “Loner!!!” Whenever someone was sitting there.
,,And they were henceforth called ‘the loner benches’.
,,It’s a cruel world we live in.
,,"Also, there were bushes with really long leaves that we used to make bows there too."
,,"We would tie it to a stick, and then we sharpened another stick to use as an arrow."
,,We must have had five bows and fifty arrows at the time.
,,"We hid them all under a tree, so no one would steal them."
,,"Until one day, some random person ran in stole a bow and arrow, and SHOT IT AT A TEACHER."
,,And that’s how THAT ended.
,,"Now that I think about this school, I don’t think we ever really learned anything there."
,,"Also, herb is pronounced erb."
,,"Weird stuff, right?"
,,"I have a very important, strange question for you."
,,Why are there so many fast food restaurants that are exactly the same?
,,What’s the point?
,,"Ask yourself that question 5 – 7 times a day, 3 – 4 times a week, 2 – 4 times a month, 12 times a year."
,,( You can take leap day off if you want ( although if you do you might find yourself in a Burger King contemplating life ( while also contemplating if $3.99 for 6 chicken wings is better than $6.99 for 10 ( and if the ketchup packets are free with a soft drink ( and if you ask that If the employee will look at you with utter bewilderment ( has this ever happened to you?
,,You are squirting your ketchup into your coke when you realise… How much do I put in!?!?
,,"I read on reddit to put 2.3 packets per 7.9 ounces of coke, and a kilogram is 2.2 pounds, so that mean 5.4 packets per kilometre per hour (ppkph) and there is 39 miles in a light nano-second and… AHHHHHHH!!!"
,,Well try the new pre-mixed ketchoke!
,,"It has that perfect flavour, time after time!"
,,Ketchoke: not copyrighted!

,,In Europe m&m’s are actually really healthy.
,,"Believe it or not, there are like six vegetables in one bag of m&m’s."
,,"Instead of using dyes like red133 and blue423, they use stuff like beetroots."
,,Isn’t that amazing / awful depending on what type of person you are.
,,In land of the lost one of the characters is eating a donut filled with m&m’s and another person asks what he’s doing.
,,He says “I’m eating a donut filled with m&m’s so I don’t have to eat m&m’s after I eat my donut”.
,,I thought you would like to know that fun fact.
,,I have a conspiracy!
,,OWLS ARE TRYING TO MAKE US DUMB!
,,People always say owls are wise!
,,But how wise can someone be who has six toes!!!
,,Six is equal to half a dozen.
,,The reason I think owls are dumb is because I HATE when people say half a dozen.
,,WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME!
,,I AM SO ANGRY AND THAT IS WHY I AM USING CAPITAL LETTERS!!!
,,"Half a dozen is FOUR SYLLABLES, and six is only one."
,,"So when someone says half a dozen, I just think “oh wow, you’re just TRYING to waste my time” “during that .5 of a second you spent saying that I could have twiddled my thumbs 3,4 times, or seen every main Naruto character in a 60 FPS environment, or listen to the first two notes of crazy frog”."
,,"Now that I think about it, during the time I made that rant about half a dozen loathing, I could have listened to the first THREE notes of crazy frog (Duh DUH duh."
,,Skip ahead to the chorus of that song..
,,CRAZY FROG!!!) Hello.
,,I have a topic for you today.
,,I was having a dream and in it there was a pink sticky note.
,,already fascinating!
,,But on it was handwriting… THAT I COULDNT READ.
,,How could my brain write words that i couldn’t even read???
,,Life makes no sense.
,,Or as AntVenom would say; LIFE makes NO SENSE?!
,,Fun fact of the paragraph: 2 to 3 times a week is almost the same as every 2 or 3 days.
,,Wahoo!
,,Next time you buy a freddo or a banana-flavoured-freddo choco bar then remember… Eat it every 2 or 3 weeks or 2 or 3 times a day!
,,(Wait thats not right…) actually – JUST EAT YOUR FREDDO!!
,,And now a special announcment: this is a shoutout to the Not Very Helpful Secrets Of Things Corporation!
,,Or the NVHSOTC.
,,Which means nothing.
,,It is a company which makes things like the little tabs at the sides of cling film boxes.
,,"No-one knows about these things, but they ‘help’ people."
,,"Also, they make things like handles on flashlights that double as a stand so the poor little electrons burst into the sky helplessly, uselessly."
,,"Without this company, the world would simply not be the same!!!"
,,"If donate ?5 to this company, or $4.815162342 (i hope those dollars dont get LOST in the mail hehehe) then you can save a turkey from strep throat."
,,The end.
,,GOODBYE!!!
,,"If you have made it this far into the official LoTeEv, then you get the official Rainbow FluffySheep Badge of Honour!!!"
,,"(Um, this isnt a badge… Its just a piece of plastic with your face on it!!"
,,"Go ahead, put it on your lappel next to your badge of boy scouts for not being sexist and letting girls into boy scout (speaking of this: they changed Canada’s national anthem from “all thy sons command” to “All thy peoples command”."
,,Why would they do that?
,,Did the ‘a’ REALLY need to be capitalised??) but how can i if there is nothing to stick it with?
,,Would you like a knife perhaps?
,,"No, anything else!"
,,I haven’t trusted you with knives ever since you tried to butter your toast and ended up slicing Milly the Cat’s third whisker to the left.
,,"Actually, i don’t NEED this badge."
,,Don’t worry!
,,"Take this – sqquuiisshh – (takes gum from mouth (tutti frutti flavour coincidentally (actually not coincidentally because this is fictional and i made it up to emulate the story (and it is altogether irrelevant anyway (some gum says its good for your teeth, so i guess it is coinci-DENTAL!"
,,(Hahahaha (the reason i picked tutti frutti is because is is multicoloured like rainbows (as in Rainbow Fluffysheep (pretty smart if (you ask me (now I’m just adding brackets for no reason)))))))))))) I DONT NEED THE BADGE!

,,(I guess that would be a problem at foot actually).
,,"Car pedals are so wierd because there is a brake, clutch and gas."
,,I always thought that there was a forwards and a backwards!
,,"(Well, until like five years ago)."
,,Sad how this world has to make simple things so complicated.
,,"There must be THOUSANDS of buttons on a plane, when all it needs is up, down, right, left, forwards, backwards, cupholder eject, radio station changer, barrel roll, mince meat dispenser and two parachutes just for the captain because they don’t care about the passengers."
,,Don’t you hate it when you are typing a list with commas and you get to the last word of the list and you realise you forgot to put an and before it?!?!
,,E.g.
,,"The colours of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (oh no i was supposed to put an and there) indigo AND violet."
,,"There ya go, a real FWP (First World Problem (theres so many abbreviations nowadays that eventually theres going to be no words, just abbreviations))."
,,Isn’t it weird that the ukelele strings aren’t in order?
,,It goes Ding dong Dong DING.
,,I wonder how that got invented?
,,It was probably some smart guy inventing an ultra-efficient stringed-instumentplaying device when his dumb friend walks up and says what does this knob do?
,,And the he goes BWOWOWOWOW.
,,"Yep, i guarantee you thats how it happened."
,,Are you in a car right now and you are bored AND its raining?
,,Pick a raindrop on the window and race it against another one.

,,"Until i write more, that is."
,,Do you know what is a great topic to ruin your fail routine?
,,What makes me not sleep at night.
,,And the answer may surprise you… BLANKETS.
,,Thunk about it.
,,The fully stuff in the inside is FEATHERS.
,,DUCK FEATHERS.
,,They kill the duck!!!
,,Or they just skin him.
,,But have you ever seen a featherless duck??
,,Exactly.
,,Skinning them would probably be worse then killing them.
,,Thy would be so ashamed to walk in public featherless.
,,"Unless they live in a hot country like spain, in which case the featherless ducks are the cool ones."
,,Noooo!!!
,,"I just realised that blankets actually are made of weird fluffy stuff, while PILLOWS are made of feathers."
,,So actually pillows are what keep me awake at night.
,,But they also keep me asleep because thats their job.
,,Its a PARADOX!!!
,,Like Shrödeners cat.
,,Im always half awake and half asleep at the same time.
,,Although I’m closer to asleep at school.
,,Because they don’t have pillows.
,,"If you cant sleep, i have a game for you, yes YOU."
,,"Scribble on a page, then colour in the spaces with two alternating colours so the colours aren’t touching."
,,It looks so cool too.
,,I have a consiracy.
,,ICE-CREAM!!!
,,It hurts SO MUCH!!!
,,The government has hidden tiny knives inside of ice-cream to STAB YOUR TEETH!
,,Its eeevil!!!
,,"They do this because then dentists get more money, which in turn… In turn causes the… the government to… lose money."
,,"Nevermind, this conspiracy has been proven FALSE by the Conspiracys Are Really Stupid commission, or COWS."
,,I guess that would be Weally Stupid.
,,Right now it is al the back in the year 2018.
,,Hello from the distant past!
,,I think ive typed enough for now.
,,Bye!!!
,,Im back!
,,With some more wwiieerrdd things for you!
,,"I was casually walking around, doing my own thing, eating a burrito (i actually wasn’t, but it adds mystery to this tale) when two people walked past me."
,,"“What you have to is multiply the elephants by five, and divide by three” “Oh, I was so close!”."
,,Now you reader try to figure out what they were talking about.
,,(Ps: you cant!
,,Hahaha!).
,,And thats what happened today.
,,Woohoo!
,,I’m so happy.
,,I have overcome my boundaries in c++ three times today.
,,"First, i put a function into a header file."
,,"Next, i saved multiple pieces of data into one text file."
,,"THEN, i saved an array to a text file."
,,Hooray!
,,If you know about c++ then you will be excited for me.
