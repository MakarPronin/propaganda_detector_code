# PropagandaDetector
This propaganda detector uses the BERT model to label text samples with the type of propaganda they contain (If they do).

# How to use:

## A) Train the model (requires GPU with CUDA):
1. Download the repository.
2. Run these commands in the console:
    pip install transformers==4.24.0
    pip install datasets==2.7.1
    pip install evaluate==0.3.0
3. Update files in the datasets folder (don't change names and format of the files).
4. Open propagandaDetector.py.
5. Uncomment "# trainModel()" line in propagandaDetector.py.
6. Run propagandaDetector.py.
7. Wait until the operation is complete.


## B) Test the model:
1. Open propagandaDetector.py.
2. Add this line with your text samples:
    print(giveLabel(["Sample1", "Sample2"]))
3. Run propagandaDetector.py.
4. Observe the output of the following format:
     [['someLable1'], ['someLable2']]

[''] label stands for "not propaganda."
